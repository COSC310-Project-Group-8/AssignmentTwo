chest routine
.A beginner routine would consist of push-ups and light dumbbell presses until you can confidently switch to the Bench press.
leg routine
.A beginner routine starts with basic body-weight squats and the leg presses. When you are comfortable, you can move up to barbell squats. (And front-squats if you want to perfect your form)
back routine
.A beginner routine would begin with low-weight one-arm dumbbell rows. Once you are sufficiently comfortable, you can add in cable rows, assisted pull-ups and heavier dumbbell curls.
